# Laser-Based-Perception-and-Navigation-with-Obstacle-Avoidance
Used sensor data from a laser range finder to avoid obstacles and navigate the robot to a given destination.
Implemented the RANSAC Algorithm to detect walls such that the robot would follow the wall in case it detected it.
Implemented Bug2 algorithm to navigate towards the goal such that the robot operates in two modes: Goal Seek, Wall Follow.
